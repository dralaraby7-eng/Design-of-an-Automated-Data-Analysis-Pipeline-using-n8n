# 📊 Design and Implementation of an Automated Data Analysis Pipeline Using n8n

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the **design and implementation of an automated data analysis pipeline** using **n8n**, an open-source workflow automation platform.  
The system processes structured data files such as **Excel (.xlsx)** and **CSV (.csv)** and automatically transforms raw data into meaningful insights and decision-support recommendations.

The project integrates **data analysis principles** with **workflow automation** to reduce manual effort and enable scalable, repeatable analytics processes.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Data analysis is often manual, repetitive, and time-consuming, especially when working with Excel and CSV files.  
Many organizations lack automated solutions that can clean data, extract insights, and generate KPIs without continuous human intervention.

This project addresses this challenge by providing a **workflow-based automated data analysis solution** using n8n.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Automate Excel and CSV data analysis  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Extract key performance indicators (KPIs)  
- Generate analytical insights  
- Provide decision-support recommendations  
- Build a scalable and reusable workflow-based system

## 🧠 Project Scope

### ✔ In Scope
- Excel and CSV data analysis  
- Data preprocessing and validation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- KPI extraction  
- Automated insight generation  
- Rule-based decision recommendations  

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Real-time streaming data  
- Advanced machine learning models  
- Unstructured data analysis  

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture
The system is built using **modular n8n workflows**, where each workflow represents a stage in the data analysis lifecycle:

1. Data ingestion  
2. Data cleaning and validation  
3. Data analysis and aggregation  
4. KPI calculation  
5. Insight generation  
6. Decision recommendation  
7. Output and reporting
